<h3>Create workouts, edit them and log them (us-1):</h3>
<p>
Peter wants an application where he can store his workouts digitally. He wants to be able to create workouts which he can later access easily. He wants an intuitive design that is easy to use for him and his family. Peter wants to be able to edit his workout(s) to keep track of progress. E.g. if Peter manages to squat 90 kg instead of 80 kg, the workout should be saved with the improved stat, and the next time the workout is opened, the last saved data is shown.

Furthermore, he wants to keep track of workouts completed over time. It should be possible to get an overview over all the workouts and when it was completed. 
In addition, it should be possible to click on a workout from the history, and see the data from that workout. This will be an even better way to track his progress over time, because he can now fetch a workout from many months ago, and compare to what he works with now. E.g. “Pull” workout which was used 12.03.2021 and 22.06.2021 could show 60 kg bench press and 75 kg bench press.

Peter lives with his wife and their two children. All of his family members are interested in using the training app, but they do not want to work on the same workouts / history. It should therefore be possible to separate a person’s workouts.
