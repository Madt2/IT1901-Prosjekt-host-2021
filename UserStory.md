Log my workouts (us-1):
As a workout enthusiast, I would like to have a program where I can save my workout logs and view the logs later. Itâ€™s important that I can enter my repetitions and working weight in the log and it saves it for me. My goal is to bench 80 kg. In order for me to reach my goal, I need to be able to track my progress. 

The user needs to be able to create a workout plan ahead of a workout and then enter new values into the workout log. The log must be able to be fetched later for the user to review. The workout should be shown in table format for easier viewing. A log overview must be available for the user to easily fetch their logs.


Important to see:
An overview over my completed workouts
View a currently active workout plan
View a completed workout plan with the entered values

Important to do:
Able to create new workout plan
Edit existing workout plan
Fetch completed workout plan to view for the user
