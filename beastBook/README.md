# BeastBook Application
This project is about an app where you can keep track of your workouts.
This is how we have imagined our final project to be.
It should be possible to ...
- create a new workout
- open a saved workout
- look at your workout log
- import and export workouts

When you create a workout it contains ...
- exercise name
- rep goal
- working weight
- number of sets
- rest time.

When you log your workout you add in the number of reps taken on each set. 
The following is an illustration of our final product
